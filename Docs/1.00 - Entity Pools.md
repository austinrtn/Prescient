## Overview
Entity Pools are semantically defined organizational structures for entities and their component data.  They are responsible for storing, managing, and manipulating all component data.  Entity Pools are generate unique internal infrastructure via Zig comptime, determined by their individual configuration, such as what component data the Entity Pool is allowed to store for entities, which component data entities are *required* to have, and how component data is stored within the pool

## Why Entity Pools? 
Entity Pools offer a unique performance and development opportunities that other ECS engines do **NOT** have by taking advantage of Zig's compile time capabilities.  Entities and their component makeups encompass a near limitless range: NPCs, UI elements, sound effects, inventory slots, world decorations, essentially everything in a game or simulation with properties.
