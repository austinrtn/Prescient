# Overview
The General Pool is Prescient's "general purpose" [[1.00 - Entity Pools|Entity Pool]] that contains every registered component within the [[Component Registry]].  
- Gives new users an accessible, "works out of the box" experience
- Introduces new users to the concept of Entity Pools
- Allows users to experiment with component compositions without registering new pools
- Creates a "home" for miscellaneous entity types that are not utilized enough to justify their own pool
# How to Use
The General Pool is declared, accessed, and configured the same as any other Entity Pool.  Since the General Pool comes included and configured in the [[1.15 - Pool Registry|Pool Registry]], it doesn't need to be added or altered. 

```c
//API
const Prescient = @import("Prescient");

pub fn main() !void {
	// New instance of Prescient
	var prescient = Prescient.init();
	
	// Get the General Pool 
	var general_pool = try prescient.getPool(.General);
	
	// Create / Destroy entities, add / remove components to your leasure 
	const particle = try general_pool.createEntity(.{
		.Position .{.x = 12, .y = 4},
		.Color = .Blue,
		//etc
	});
}
```
