# Overview

###### Archetype Storage:
An archetype in an ECS context is a data structure that contains a *struct of arrays* for component data, for each unique component makeup that exists within an instance of the engine.  For example, let's say there is a entity pool that manages entities, and this EnemyPool 


```zig
const storage = ComponentStorage{
	entities: {ent1, ent2, ent3,},
	positions: {
		{.x = 0, .y = 0}, {.x = 4, .y = 2}, {.x = 12, .y = 6}
	},
}
```
