# Overview
Pool configuration defines the compile-time parameters that determine how an [[1.00 - Entity Pools|Entity Pool]] stores and manages its entities. Each pool's configuration generates a unique internal architecture optimized for that pool's specific use case.

This individualized approach enables both performance gains and enhanced type safety. Pools can be optimized for different access patterns, enforce component requirements at compile-time, and enable intelligent query routing—all without runtime overhead.  

# How to Configure
Pools are configured by passing a **PoolConfig** struct to the `EntityPool` function when creating pools in the [[1.02 - Pool Registry|Pool Registry]].

>[!example] Inside The Struct
>```zig
>pub const PoolConfig {
>	name: PoolRegistry.PoolName,
>	components: ComponentRegistry.ComponentName,
>	req: ComponentRegistry.ComponentName = null,
>	storage_strategy: StorageStrategy, 
>}
>```

### Configuration Arguments
**`name: PoolRegistry.PoolName`**
Identifies the pool within the registry. By convention, the `PoolName` enum value should match the pool's variable name.

**`components: []const ComponentRegistry.ComponentName`**
Defines which components entities in this pool *may* have. This shapes the pool's internal storage infrastructure and enables compile-time query mapping. Attempting to add unlisted components results in a compile-time error.

**`req: []const ComponentRegistry.ComponentName`** *(optional)*
Defines which components entities *must* have upon creation and cannot remove. Defaults to null and is a completely optional field. Attempting to create entities without required components, or removing required components, results in compile-time errors.

**`storage_strategy: PoolConfig.StorageStrategy`**
Determines whether the pool uses [[Archetype]] or [[Sparse-Set]] storage internally.

>[!example]
># Creating PoolConfig Struct
>```zig
>//PoolRegistry.zig
>const particleConfig = .{
>	.name = .particlePool,
>	.components = .&{
>		.Velocity,
>		.Color,
>	},
>	.req = .&{ 
>		.Position 
>	},
>	.storage_strategy = .Sparse,
>};
>
>pub const ParticlePool = EntityPool(particleConfig);
>```
>
># PoolConfig with Struct Literals
>Use Zig's struct literals for to configure pools more conveniently
>```zig
>pub const enemyPool = EntityPool(.{
>	.name = .PlayerPool,
>	.components = &.{
>		.Attack,
>		.Mana,
>		.Status
>	},
>	.req = &.{
>		.Posistion,
>		.Velocity,
>		.Health
>	},
>	.storage_strategy = .archetype,
>});
